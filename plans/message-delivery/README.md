# `Plan:` Message Delivery (PubSub)

## What is being optimized (min/max, reach)

- (Minimize) The time between publisher publishing a message and all subscribers receiving it
- (Minimize) Overall bandwidth consumed (either by topology forming or message routing)
- (Minimize) Duplicated messages received
- (Maximize) Success of delivery

## Plan Parameters

- **Network Parameters**
  - `Region` - Region or Regions where the test should be run at (default to single region)
  - `N` - Number of nodes that are spawn for the test (from 10 to 1000000)
- **Image Parameters**
  - GO_IPFS_VERSION - The go-ipfs version number or commit that is being tested
  - Image Resources CPU & Ram
