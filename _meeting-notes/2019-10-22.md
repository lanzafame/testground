## :mega: Update (Done, Shipped, Made Progress)

- ==@daviddias==
  - Completed the "go-ipfs as a Library" Tutorial, now in review phase by the docs Team https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6695/
  - Landed smlbench working with TestGround orchestrator (thank you Jim for helping with the last mile there ❤️) https://trello.com/c/1LTXALLW/62-get-smlbench-plan-to-work-with-testground-orchestrator
  - Continue iterating on the Test Plan spec  https://trello.com/c/0erPZId8/43-specify-10-test-plans
    - now with differentiation for Plan & Test Parameters https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/76
    - now each Test Plan lives with the plan folder of the Plan itself https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/77
  - Revisited the OKRs as requested https://trello.com/c/o09gs18G/63-review-and-iterate-on-q4-okrs
  - Created a draft Roadmap for review https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pulls
  - Got sick, then got better :) ETOOMUCHLONGFLIGHTS
  - Broke a tooth 🦷 (tip: watch out for those Swiss Ricolas!). **FYI** will be traveling this week to Lisbon for a emergency dentist appt (and a reschedule of others I was going to reschedule to post hack week, but this way I merge it all together rather than going to Lisbon 2x). This means that I'm almost at 2 days of lost work given flying + transportation + being at the dentist.
- ==@jimpick==
  - smlbench (adds a randomly generated file on one node, gets it from a 2nd node)
    - initial work, one docker container, IPTB with 2 IPFS nodes https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/74
    - follow-on work, two dockers containers, IPTB with 1 IPFS node per container, using Sync SDK (redis) to co-ordinate https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/74
  - Lots of little puzzles solved:
    - IPFS into Docker using Docker.template and conditional via shell script (works, but not satisfied)
    - IPTB SDK usage
    - Sync SDK usage
  - Tested on a single EC2 vm ... going to test on multiple VMs today

## :question: Questions (Blockers, Technical Design needs)

- (@jimpick) - Error handling patterns - which ones?
  - panic(err)
  - runenv.Abort(err)
  - log.Fatal("error message", err)
  - return result, err
  - just exit process?
  - expected number of tests? eg. TAP (test anything protocol) http://testanything.org/tap-specification.html
  - Example code: https://github.com/ipfs/testground/blob/plan-smlbench-two-containers/plans/smlbench2/main.go
  - A:
    - Option:
      - A) Given that we are paying to run these tests, once a test fails, we should just shutdown the whole thing
      - B) Differentiate types of error (e.g. fatal & error), one goes through path A, the other gets gathered by the same pipeline that grabs metrics and takes them to Elastic Search
      - C) Rely on another process (the main orchestrator) to make the decision to stop or continue depending on type of test
        - Dependency: Needs the TestGround daemon done first 
- (@jimpick) - How to organize tests that run multiple times with different file sizes?
  - A: It lives within the Test Parameters
  - Follow up Question:
    - Where does the decision of running the test multiple times happens? Options:
      - A) In the Orchestrator (loop outside)
        - Steven prefers this one. Ideally there should be a matrix of parameters.
      - B) In the Test Case itself (loop inside)
      - 
- (@jimpick) - Tradeoff questions:
  - Tests that run scenarios (even if ugly) vs. clean looking tests?
  - How much code review?
    - Always for code. 
  - Refactoring into SDK?
    - For Q4, good to go ugly, 2020 Q1, reconsider and/or refactor
- (@daviddias) - On onboarding more folks, we should we go after? :D
  - Dirk? -> Bitswap related Test Plans
  - Adin? -> DHT related Test Plans
  - Alex? -> Not for now
  - ?? Yes to write the Test Plan themselves, not the TestGround code

## :dart: Next

### OKRs for the Quarter

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipfs/testground/master/docs/img/Q4OKRs.png)

### Top 3 things to get done this week

- Finalize the spec for the 10 Test Plans
- Land [Plan: Data Exchange with Datasets of Interest (BitSwap/GraphSync)](https://github.com/ipfs/testground/blob/master/docs/tests-mvp.md#plan-data-exchange-with-datasets-of-interest-bitswapgraphsync) end-to-end (Plan, Tests & Graphs) so that we can onboard Dirk that needs it for testing Bitswap changes
- ~~Rope in Adin by onboarding him to the Network Connectivity Test Plans (needs the spec to be finalized and an example using TC done)~~ Given the limited amount of time, we might not be able to do it this week and only on the next.

### Assignments

- ==@stebalien==
  - `P0` Reach out to Dirk to see if he can review the Test Plan https://github.com/ipfs/testground/tree/master/plans/data-transfer-datasets-random
  - Review all Test Plan https://github.com/ipfs/testground/blob/master/docs/PLAN_SPEC.md
- ==@daviddias==
  - Continue working on Test Plan 1
  - Push a draft for the remaining Test Plans
  ~~- Create Work Packages~~
    ~~- Create testground-sdk in JS~~
    ~~- Port ipfs/interop tests to Test Ground~~
    ~~- Port ipfs/benchmarks tests to Test Ground~~
  - Schedule a Pair Programming session to review Test Plan 2 for the Week of Oct 28
  - Schedule a discussion with Jim to review what we want to visualize in Kibana for Test Plan 2
- ==@jimpick==
 - Onboard / AWS/Elasticsearch Docs
 - Test Plan 2
   - Rename smlbench2
   - Multiple vms
   - Common docker repository
   - Common redis
   - Docker swarm
   - Simple custom traffic shaping with `tc`
   - Do something on the reporting end of things
   - Basic test organization
 - Better local development story (i'm using vim via ssh to EC2, no IDE)
