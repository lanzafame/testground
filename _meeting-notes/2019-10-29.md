## :question: Questions (Blockers, Technical Design needs)
> We only have 30 mins for this section, use your time wisely

- (@dirkmc, 5 min)
  - I have good knowledge of Bitswap codebase but not as much knowledge of Bitswap in the wild
    I'd love to get some feedback on parameters for a realistic, real-world scenario
    - Session Discovery (session queries connected peers and then asks DHT)
    - How often do timeouts actually occur in practice once a peer has connected?
    - Ephemeral nodes
    - Request patterns: Wikipedia vs Large file vs Small files vs ...
  - I think it makes sense for me to start helping out with testground (beyond just writing tests üêπ)
    - Is testground at a point where that makes sense?
      - A: Yes.
    - Is there a good chunk for me to break off and work on?
      - A: No, it would be better if you interfaced with the team as a user and builder of one of the plans. (I'm sure you will find bugs along the way and provide patches)
- (@jimpick, 5min)
  - Looping over test variants ... how to do it?
  - continuation of discussion from last week, but with Raul
  - eg. "seeds/peers" combinations https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/82
    - Answer: 
      - Test Case is a just template/behaviour
      - The "looping over test variants" sits a layer above the Plans. Examples:
        - In the Github Integration
        - In the Test Ground runner process
      - A Test Case is run with specific parameters on a trigger event. This trigger event can be: CLI call, a Github event, etc
      - We might get concept of recipes (a base config to run the multiple cases in a plan)
- (@daviddias, 5min) Trello doesn't seem to be working, we still love Kanban.
  - People are not visiting Trello often
  - Information in Trello is different from Github. Requires constant sync'ing
  - Proposal: Move to ZenHub
    - Information will all live in Github issues (where developers love it)
    - It will give the Project Manager the view it needs to understand progress
    - Open Source Contributors will always have access to the information about the project
    - Less one spot to maintain information
  - Votes
    - Yes: David, Raul <= Yes won, we now use Zenhub, see #92 
    - No:
    - No opinion: Jim
- (@jimpick, 5min) 
  - Cluster setup demo (AWS/Ansible)
- (@jimpick, 5min)
  - Simplified cluster runner proposal
  - https://trello.com/c/2MJwZ71P/68-multi-machine-ssh-or-http-api-runner

### OKRs for the Quarter

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipfs/testground/master/docs/img/Q4OKRs.png)

### Top 3 things to get done this week

- "A Test Plan" is complete (end to end, meaning: we spawn nodes, we run the test on AWS infra from our own local box and we see results in Kibana)
- Prepare for Hack Week (folks, free your schedule, it will be a week of HACKIIING)
- (When Test Plan 2 is done) Onboard other folks to contribute specific Test Plans to Test Ground

  - Complete the runner local:go
  - Review the Roadmap PR https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/75
- ==@jimpick==
  - Get smlbench2 code-reviewed and merged to master somewhere as an example (it's a subset of test plan 2 / bitswap test)
  - Get ansible automation and packer template merged
  - Prototype super-simple test runner (non-Docker Swarm) so we can experiment as a team next week
  - Help Dirk with bitswap test case
  - Discuss ideas for higher level of automation (auto-provisioning EC2 machines), self-serve platform
- ==@daviddias==
  - (Now that Raul is back) Schedule a Pair Programming session to review Test Plan 2 for the Week of Oct 28 (this week)
